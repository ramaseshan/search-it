search-it
=========
A search application that will help users search for files in their system.
Use * or ? or use windows or linux, It dosent matter. All you need is python :)

* Supports only Linux for now
* Searches only for files with any pattern


TODO :
* Test it on windows
* Search for Folders
* Write a GUI
* Installation Process on machines
* Indexing of drives or external drives
* Ability to search the index, without actually inserting any external drive (If already indexed)
* Network Searching, would that be possible the same way ?? (Research and validate)

IMPORTANT :

* Any Help is always welcome.
* If you find my code clumsy, feel free to suggest better code.
* New Ideas are welcome
